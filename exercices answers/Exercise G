SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name FROM student s INNER JOIN person p ON (s.person_id = p.id) WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF (YEAR, p.birthdate, CURDATE()) BETWEEN 19 and 21;

To optimize the query I would create a calculated column with the age of each person:

ALTER TABLE person
ADD age INT AS TIMESTAMPDIFF (YEAR, birthdate, CURDATE());
